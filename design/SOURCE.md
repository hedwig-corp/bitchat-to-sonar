# Sonar design handoff — vendored

The complete design handoff bundle lives in `design/handoff/`. It is **vendored**
(checked in) so agents read it from disk instead of re-fetching every time.

- **Source share:** https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/H5tEQgWekwCuHihJuEYcxw (Claude Design / claude.ai/design)
- **Last synced:** 2026-06-14 (this refresh updated `project/sonar/{screens,data,theme}.*` and
  added `project/uploads/Screenshot 2026-06-14 at 02.04.36.png` — the design was revised since the
  prior 2026-06-12 vendoring, which is why the radar peer-tap UI changed).

## What's the source of truth

Per the bundle README (`design/handoff/README.md`) and the repo DESIGN RULE
(reproduce 1:1, do NOT reskin):

- **App design** = `design/handoff/project/Sonar Prototype.html` + its imports in
  `design/handoff/project/sonar/*` (`app.jsx`, `screens.jsx`, `components.jsx`,
  `data.js`, `icons.jsx`, `pay.jsx`, `settings.jsx`, `theme.css`).
- **Desktop** = `Sonar Desktop.html` + `sonar/desktop*.{jsx,css}`.
- **Marketing site** (NOT the app) = `Sonar Landing.html`.
- **Intent / back-and-forth** = `design/handoff/chats/chat1.md` (read this for what the user wanted).

## To refresh

Re-fetch the share URL (it returns a gzipped tar), extract, and `cp -R` the
`bitchat-review/.` over `design/handoff/`. Update the "Last synced" date above.
