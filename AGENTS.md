## Cross-Platform Feature Rule

Sonar is a multi-platform product. New user-facing features must be designed and implemented for every supported app surface unless a platform limitation is documented in the change itself.

When adding or changing a feature, cover the native Apple app (`ios/`) and the Compose Multiplatform app (`apps/sonar/`) together. If a capability cannot ship on one platform in the same change, leave an explicit tracked gap with the platform, reason, and follow-up path.
