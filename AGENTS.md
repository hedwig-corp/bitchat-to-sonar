# Repository Guidance

## Cross-Platform Feature Rule

Sonar is a multi-platform product. New user-facing features must be designed and implemented for every supported app surface unless a platform limitation is documented in the change itself.

When adding or changing a feature, cover the native Apple app (`ios/`) and the Compose Multiplatform app (`apps/sonar/`) together. If a capability cannot ship on one platform in the same change, leave an explicit tracked gap with the platform, reason, and follow-up path.

## Signal-Comparable Performance Rule

Conversation and transcript changes must preserve Signal-comparable local-first performance. Opening an existing chat must paint from local storage first and must not wait on relay/server sync, full-history scans, or unrelated groups before first paint. If a change can make chat opening, sending, or scrolling meaningfully slower than Signal-style local database windowing, design a bounded local page/window path, move sync to the background, and document any platform gap with a follow-up path.
